            <p>42 Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.</p>
            <p>43 But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.</p>
            <p>44 Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.</p>
            <p>45 Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?</p>
